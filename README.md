===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).



# To run the game:

Just open **index.html** in your browser and you're good to go.

# How to Play:

* Use the **arrow keys** (up, down, left, right) to move around the game board.
* Attempt to cross the road and get to the water without getting run over!
* Reaching the water will add one point to your score, but...
* Getting hit by a ladybug will reset your score to zero!
* See how high you can get your score!
